## How it works

- Choose the genre you are in the mood for.
- You can also specify the language and the preferable release date of the movie you wish to watch.
- Then, select the movies you have watched and liked from a list of 10 movies picked from the top 250 following the set conditions.
- If you do not like any of the 10 options provided you can always press refresh and ask for more.
- Depending on the choices you make we provide you with one movie perfectly suited for you.
- If you are not satisfied with the recommendation, no worries, press pass and we will recommend another movie for you.

## Recommendation System

- We use the Content-Based Recommendation system where we take your previous likings in order to recommend a movie to you.
- Similar movies are found by transforming parameters like plot, keywords, director, writer, actor, and genre to vectors and then using cosine similarity on them.
- We use `sklearn CountVectorizer` to convert the parameters from text to vector/token counts.
- `Cosine Similarity` is used to plot the similarities. The output varies from 0-1 where where 1 denotes 100% similarity.
- Using this we can find the cosΘ between the two vectors.
- We then sort the possible recommendations for each movie based on the number of times it was suggested primarily and the movie’s rating to find the perfect match.

## Dataset

- We got ratings, crew information, genre for every movie on iMDb from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/.
- We then got the poster, plot, original language and keywords for every movie using the unique iMDb id with the help of `TMDB API`
- We removed all movies pre 1990 for relevance.
- We then grouped all the movies by genre and rated them using the **True Bayesian estimation**.
- Weighted Rating(WR) = (v/v+m).R + (m/m+v).C
  - Where v is the number of votes, m is the minimum number of votes the movie should get to be considered, C is mean vote and R is the average rating of the movie.
  - We chose m to be 80th percentile of the number of votes in the database which turns out to be 4229 votes.
  - C for our dataset was around 6.
